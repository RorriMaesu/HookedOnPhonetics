## Overview

Hooked On Phonetics is a comprehensive literacy platform that provides interactive tools for phonics, fluency, morphology, sentence construction, semantic analysis, context clues, story mapping, speech practice, and writing workshops. The platform is built on an "Integrated Structured-Literacy Stack" that combines evidence-based approaches to literacy instruction with modern technology.

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Firebase Functions
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for content generation

### Pedagogical Core

Our "Integrated Structured-Literacy Stack" includes:

| Layer                           | Approach                                                            | Implementation                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phonology ‚Üí Phonics**         | Link manipulation tasks to letters to speed catch-up                | 2-min sound‚Äìletter drills before each decoding micro-lesson           |
| **Syllables & Morphology**      | Multisyllabic decoding strategies + explicit morphology instruction | One "3-step" syllable routine; color-coded morphemes                  |
| **Fluency Bridge**              | Guided + repeated oral reading; silent-fluency programs             | Weekly: 2 guided reads, 1 auto-timed silent-read challenge            |
| **Vocabulary & Syntax**         | Direct morphology + academic-word teaching; sentence-combining      | Vocabulary in phonics, fluency and writing games                      |
| **Comprehension Strategies**    | Summarize, question-generate, monitor, recognize text structures    | Animated thought-bubble prompts; auto-filling graphic organizers      |
| **Writing & Spelling Loop**     | Encoding practice; SRSD writing routines                            | Quick-write after each reading lesson; SRSD planner for longer pieces |
| **Digital & Critical Literacy** | Media-literacy skills for evaluating AI-driven content              | Monthly "Think-Like-a-Fact-Checker" quests                            |

### Adaptive Learning Brain

The platform uses Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Item Response Theory (IRT) to personalize learning:

- **BKT-inside-Firestore:** For each micro-skill, Cloud Functions store four BKT parameters and update mastery probability
- **IRT-flavoured Diagnostics:** Initial CAT chooses items that maximize information

### Key Features

- **Phonics Playground**: Interactive phonics exercises with Sound-Swap games and Elkonin-Box tile linking
- **Fluency Studio**: Timed WCPM (Words Correct Per Minute) practice with prosody coaching
- **Morphology Lab**: Word-Factory with color-coded morpheme analysis
- **Sentence Combiner**: Three-step complexity ladder for sentence construction
- **Context Clue Detective**: Interactive unknown-word highlighter with context clue routines
- **Story Map Builder**: Interactive story-grammar maps and expository inference missions
- **Speech Practice**: Web Speech recognition with confidence-band UI and self-validation
- **Writing Workshop**: POW+TREE tabbed wizard with revision checklists and peer-review prompts
- **Skill Tree Dashboard**: Hexagonal grid showing skill mastery and recommended next steps
- **Motivation Engine**: Features designed to satisfy Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness needs

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Adaptive Learning Algorithm

The application implements a sophisticated adaptive learning system that combines:

- **Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)**: Probabilistic framework for modeling knowledge acquisition
- **Item Response Theory (IRT)**: Statistical framework for designing and analyzing assessments
- **Cloud Functions**: Serverless backend for real-time skill mastery updates

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

The application is built as a Progressive Web App, providing:

- Offline functionality
- Install-to-home-screen capability
- Fast loading times with service worker caching
- Responsive design for all device sizes

### Real-time Collaboration

The platform includes real-time collaboration features:

- Shared whiteboard for teletherapy sessions
- Real-time progress tracking for educators
- Collaborative writing spaces for peer feedback

## Key Modules

The application consists of several integrated modules that work together to provide a comprehensive literacy learning experience:
